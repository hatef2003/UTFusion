# UTFusion - Sensor Fusion Project

## Project Purpose
UTFusion is a **Qt-based C++ application** designed to perform sensor fusion between **camera** and **radar** data.  
The primary goal is to correlate data from these two different sensor types to obtain a **more accurate** and **robust** understanding of the environment.  

This project uses **mock servers** to simulate sensor data, making it a good platform for developing and testing fusion algorithms **without the need for physical hardware**.

---

## Features Overview
- **Multi-Sensor Integration**: Fuses data from simulated camera and radar sensors.  
- **Mock Data Servers**: Includes TCP servers to mock radar, camera, and object detection data streams.  
- **Coordinate Transformation**: Converts 2D pixel coordinates to 3D world coordinates.  
- **Synchronization**: Buffers and synchronizes data based on timestamps to process related data points together.  
- **Modular Design**: Fusion logic, data handling, and sensor interfaces are separated into different classes for extensibility.

## Dependencies and Installation

This project is built with the **Qt framework**.

- **Qt 6.x** (Download from [Qt Official Website](https://www.qt.io/download))
    - During installation, select:
        - `Qt Core`
        - `Qt Gui`
        - `Qt Network`
- **C++17 Compiler** (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)

## How to Build and Run the Project

### Building with Qt Creator
1. Open the `UTFusion.pro` file in **Qt Creator**.
2. Configure with a Qt 6 kit (e.g., `Desktop Qt 6.6.3 MinGW 64-bit`).
3. Build the project: **Build > Build Project "UTFusion"**.
4. Run the application: **Build > Run**.

### Building from the Command Line
(Provide your platform-specific `qmake` / `cmake` commands here if needed.)

---

## Running the Application
After building, the executable will be located in a directory like:  
`build/Desktop_Qt_6_6_3_MinGW_64_bit-Debug/debug/`

When running, the application starts **three TCP servers**:

| Server Name             | Port |
|-------------------------|------|
| MockRadarData           | 8000 |
| MockImageReceiver       | 8080 |
| ErfanMocker (Object Detection) | 8001 |

To see the fusion in action, you must send data to these ports from another application (e.g., a Python script).

Notes / Improvements
Real Sensor Integration: Replace mock classes with actual hardware interfaces for real-world usage.

const_cast Usage: Avoid unsafe usage in main.cpp; prefer storing QImage by value or using QSharedPointer<QImage>.

Incomplete Fusion Implementation: Clarify relationship between Fuse and Fusion classes; resolve commented-out references in .pro file.

Error Handling: Improve TCP server handling for disconnections and malformed data.

Configuration: Replace hardcoded server ports with configurable options (command-line or config file).

## Accuracy Tests

Our project includes a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests to verify the correctness, robustness, and synchronization of different system components. Below is a summary of the main test modules:

### 1. **MockRadarData Tests** (`mockradardata_test.cpp`)

* **Purpose:** Validate receiving and parsing of radar data over TCP.
* **Key Tests:**

  * `testSingleMessage`: Ensures a complete radar message (values + timestamp) is correctly received and parsed.
  * `testMissingTimestamp`: Verifies correct behavior when a timestamp is missing (defaults to `0`).
* **Focus:** Network communication, data integrity, and timestamp handling.

---

### 2. **Buffer Tests** (`buffer_test.cpp`)

* **Purpose:** Check buffer operations for synchronized radar and camera data.
* ** Tests:**

  * `testEmptyReadThrows`: Ensures reading from an empty buffer throws an exception.
  * `testAddAndReadSync`: Verifies correct synchronization when radar and camera timestamps are within the allowed drift.
  * `testNotSyncBeyondDrift`: Confirms data is considered unsynchronized when timestamps exceed the drift limit.
* **Focus:** Data synchronization, exception handling.

---

### 3. **DataContainer Tests** (`datacontainer_tests.cpp`)

* **Purpose:** Validate data storage, retrieval, and synchronization in the `DataContainer`.
* **Tests:**

  * `testGetDataBeforeAny`: Ensures exceptions are thrown when no data is available.
  * `testSyncAfterRadarThenCam`: Validates correct synchronization when radar data arrives first.
  * `testSyncAfterCamThenRadar`: Validates correct synchronization when camera data arrives first.
* **Focus:** Data ordering, synchronization logic, error handling.

---

### 4. **Fuse Tests** (`fuse_test.cpp`)

* **Purpose:** Ensure the fusion module emits events correctly when processing data.
* **Tests:**

  * `testOperationDoneOnce`: Checks that `OperationDone` is emitted exactly once per data set.
  * `testOperationDoneTwice`: Ensures multiple emissions occur for multiple inputs.
* **Focus:** Event emission correctness.

---

### 5. **MockImageReceiver Tests** (`mockimagereciever_test.cpp`)

* **Purpose:** Validate image receiving logic over TCP.
* **Tests:**

  * `testIgnoreIncompletePacket`: Ensures incomplete packets are ignored and no false data reception is reported.
* **Focus:** Network robustness, packet validation.

---

### 6. **ErfanMocker Tests** (`erfanmocker_test.cpp`)

* **Purpose:** Test a mock radar & pixel data generator for the fusion pipeline.
* **Tests:**

  * `test_singleValidMessage`: Validates processing of a full, valid message.
  * `test_missingTimestamp`: Checks correct handling when timestamp is missing.
  * `test_emptyPixelsAllowed`: Verifies that empty pixel arrays are processed without errors.
* **Focus:** Input validation, handling of edge cases.
